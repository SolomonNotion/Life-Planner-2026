Attitude Adjustment Life Planner (Notion)

A Notion-based planning system designed to help users monitor mindset, identify behavioral patterns, and make more deliberate decisions over time.

Problem this template addresses

Many planning systems track tasks and goals but ignore the role of mindset and behavioral patterns in execution.

This planner introduces a structured way to:

* Observe daily attitudes and reactions
* Identify recurring triggers and responses
* Review patterns over time
* Make incremental behavioral adjustments
System structure

The template is built around four core components:

Daily Attitude Log**
  Short entries capturing mood, context, and response.

Trigger–Response Tracker**
  Records situations, reactions, and alternative responses for later review.

Values & Principles Reference**
  A static reference used to guide decisions and self-evaluation.

Weekly Review Dashboard**
  Aggregates entries to highlight patterns and support intentional adjustment.

Each component is designed to remain lightweight to encourage long-term use.

Intended users

* Individuals interested in structured self-reflection
* Professionals managing stress, responsibility, or decision fatigue
* Users who prefer calm, minimal systems over motivational tools
* Notion users looking for a behavior-focused planning framework
